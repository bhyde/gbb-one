This is based on the GBBOpen tutorial.

GBBOpen is an implementation of the Blackboard Design Pattern, i.e.
a scheme that helps to coordinate the work of a number of so called
Knowledge Source (i.e. applications) by providing a place were they
can rondevous known as a blackboard.  The blackboard is a set of
objects that representation of the current state of the problem
the system is working on (i.e. it's a represents the problem space).
Knowledge source can install triggers that fire when various events
happen as the problem state changes.

In the GBBOpen tutorial, and this code, a blackboard is used by two
very simple knowledge sources, start and random-walker.  The only information
place upon the blackboard are instances of the unit-instance class location.

The work done by these knowledge sources is coordinated by the built
in control shell.  We add event handlers which fire when the shell
starts and as things finish up, i.e. quiescence.  Upon starting we
create the blackboard, and when things quiet down we print the random
walk taken by the random-walker.

This example thus illustrates:
+ how a blackboard consist of some number of spaces, in this case one named '(known-word),
+ how knowledge sources are driven by event triggers (three in fact:
 + control-shell-started which is used by our start KS,
 + (instance-created-event location) which is used by our random-walker);
+ how instances on the blackboard maybe linked to each other in a
  fairly elegant manner.

The ASDF system definition has two components:
+ bar.lisp the actual application in bar.lisp, and
+ startup.lisp a bit of junk to get things bootstrapped.
It also depends on gbbopen, and alexandria.

To run this you ought to be able to place this where your quicklisp
can find it and then do:
```common-lisp
(ql:quickload "gbb-one")
(gbbopen-user::go-go)
```
The go-go function discards any existing blackboard and then runs the
control shell.  You can run go-go repeatedly, and in the comments
you'll find examples of how to do various kinds of tracing and how to
displace the state of things.  For example after running go-go you
can display a summary of the blackboard.

GBBOpen's modularity is a layered, like an archaeology dig.  There is
an old module system bundled with it, let's call those gbbopen
modules.  Clever code is provided to get ASDF working for those
modules.  Quicklisp then works because it stands on ASDF.  I don't
fully understand this clever code.  It it appears broken in some
scenarios.  It appears that those in the know always load a file known
as initialize.lisp, and you can see I load that in startup.lisp, and
then I load the gbbopen module called gbbopen-user.  One feature of
initialize.lisp is that it provides a number of "repl commands."  I'm
prejudiced against repl commands.  So I haven't given them the
attention they probably deserve.  I wrap the load of the initialize
file in an attempt to suppress it's tendency to change the current
package.

There are some self indulgent macrolets in bar.lisp.
